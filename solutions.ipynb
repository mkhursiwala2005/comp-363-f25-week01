    "## Technical notes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of the solution below, written as Python classes `MST_1` and `MST_2` respectively. The second class has a few extra utility methods to make the code more readable. And most of its utility methods return any values; instead they use class fields to hold them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both classes employ the two utility methods we discussed in class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reachability` is a method that returns the vertices of a graph reachable from a given vector.\n",
    "- `count_and_label` is a method that counts the components in a graph and labels their vertices with their component number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk of the work is done in the `boruvka` method. The method can be summarized in two lines of pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "while the output graph has more than 1 components:\n",
    "  connect components with a safe edge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm basically tells us which edges from the input graph $G$ to add to the output graph $T$: edges from $G$ that will connect the components of $T$, in the cheapest way. These are what we call _safe edges_. So we have to constantly explore $T$ for components and connect them with the smallest possible edge (from $G$). The output $T$ becomes the minimum spanning tree of $G$ when there are no more components in $T$ to connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the algorithm iterates over the components of $T$, their number dwindles. And because there can be one and only one edge between any two components, the number of safe edges in each iteration also decreases. At the end of each iteration, the safe edges between components of $T$ become edges in $T$. So, the number of edges in $T$ increases. Finally, there will be $n-1$ edges in $T$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$ (and $T$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The difference** between a safe edge of a component in $T$ and a plain edge in the same graph, is subtle and important. A safe edge is temporary -- that's why we use a separate data structure to track them. A plain edge is an actual part of the graph. That's why we track them in the graph's adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `boruvka` method can be broken down in these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Look at every edge in the input graph $G$\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for u in range(self.n):\n",
    "  for v in range(u+1, self.n):\n",
    "    if self.G[u][v] != self.no_edge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check if $u, v$ in different components of graph $T$\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "      if component_label[u] != component_label[v]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check for safe edge between the components with $u$ and $v$ in them\n",
    "\n",
    "When the conditions are met, the method asks if there is a safe edge out of the component with vertex $u$ first. There may or may not be. If there is no safe edge, we make the current edge ($u,v$) the safe edge for the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        if safe_edge[component_label[u]] is None:\n",
    "          safe_edge[component_label[u]] = [u,v]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, there is already a safe edge for the component with vertex $u$, we need to compare it with the edge we are visiting currently (that's edge $(u,v)$). If the current edge is smaller that the existing safe edge, we must accept it as the new safe edge:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "          [a, b] = safe_edge[component_label[u]]\n",
    "          if self.G[u][v] < self.G[a][b]:\n",
    "            safe_edge[component[u]] = [u, v]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we obtain the vertices $a,b$ for the existing safe edge. We use them to access the weight of that edge (available in the input graph as $G[a][b]$) and compare it to the weight of the edge $(u,v)$ we are currently visiting. We look up edge weights in the input graph $G$. The code in the solution `MST_1.boruvka` is a bit more verbose to provide a step-by-step approach to the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat the same task for the component with the other vertex $v$, of the edge we are exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Copy safe edges to $T$\n",
    "\n",
    "After each exploration of all edges in $G$, we have a safe edge for every component in $T$. These edges are added to the adjacency matrix of $T$ with a simple loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for edge in safe_edges:\n",
    "  if edge: # not None\n",
    "    [u, v] = edge\n",
    "    self.T[u][v] = self.G[u][v]\n",
    "    self.G[u][v] = self.T[v][u]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update counts and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "After all the safe edges during the iteration have been added to the output graph $T$, we are expecting fewer components in it. So we recount the components and we relabel the vertices with their new component labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to assess your code\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on your `boruvka` method (it's ok if you gave it a different name). Qualitatively, the code should initialize a component count and component labels for output graph $T$. The methods to do so were developed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the method should have a principal loop to iterate while there are 2 or more components in the output graph $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the principal loop, the method should explore every edge in $G$ in the most efficient way possible. Surely we can write nested loops like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for u in range(self.n):\n",
    "  for v in range(self.n):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but that would be redundant because of the properties of an undirected graph. Specifically, the symmetry of the adjancency matrix $G[u][v] = G[v][u]$ including the edgeless characteristic of its diagonal, $G[u][u] = \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, look how close you got to tracking and comparing safe edges. This is the most difficult part of the implementation. In your reflection, note what you missed, and what you learned when you compared your code with mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if you see anything that can be improved in my code, let me know.\n"
